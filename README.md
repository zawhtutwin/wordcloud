# WordCloud

WordCloud's goal is to create a powerful and user friendly Words Frequencies based on Java. WordCloud directly generates an list of words with corresponding frequcie.

The list generated from WordCloud can be used in tools like [WordArt](https://wordart.com/) (Checked the CSV in option).

The online tool of Wordcloud is [here](http://wordpeep-wordpeople.1d35.starter-us-east-1.openshiftapps.com/WordCloud/).

Upload the text file that you want to get the word/frequecy and you will get the result in next page.

This program is based on [Kumo](https://github.com/kennycason/kumo) which is a brainchild of Kenny Cason.
